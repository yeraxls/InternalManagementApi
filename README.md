This api is designed to manage customers and invoices.
It is currently a small test, based on entityframework in memory to not need a database.

The next steps will be:
- Finish the invoices part 
- Finish Client detail, where you bring the invoices by IdClient
- Login system with its table
- Basic security of the application by login
- Docker this Api


Remember that this API is intended to be consumed through another API, when it is created I will put the url here
